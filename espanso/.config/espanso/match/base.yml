# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"

  - trigger: ":zettelkasten"
    replace: "{{zettelkastendate}}"
    vars:
      - name: zettelkastendate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y%m%d%H%M%S"

  - trigger: ":epoch"
    replace: "{{epoch}}"
    vars:
      - name: epoch
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%s"

  - trigger: ":ISOdate"
    replace: "{{ISO}}"
    vars:
      - name: ISO
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%+"

  - trigger: ":lennyface"
    replace: "( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

  - trigger: ":fitnessgram"
    replace: "The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start."
